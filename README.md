# shellinabox-autologin-local-test
Very few information on how to auto login the server web-based by shellinabox. 
Actually I found only a single sentence in original shellinabox packages to say something about auto login. 
No detailed case at all.

The file gave very detailed information on how to download the file and install the enviroment, and how to auto
login the virtual machines with 6 interfaces at the same time. OS is Ubuntu12.04.
But the file only tested on a local server. Dont have a chance to test on the remote server. 
At least shellinabox works on local machine very well.
Not sure if it still works. Work or not, please share with me. Thanks.

(I didnot hide the account and the password on the address, don't have a changce to find the good way to hide them. Will keep posted)

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions and better ideas. Thanks.
